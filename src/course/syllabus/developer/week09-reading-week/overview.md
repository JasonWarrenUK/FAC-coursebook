### Week of November 4th

## .NET

### Route 01. Csharp Certification

This option focuses entirely on mastering C# before diving into broader .NET concepts. The goal is for you to gain a strong command of the language and become comfortable with its infrastructure. By Week 10, you'll be able to apply what you’ve learned to a hands-on project.

To start, please register on both FreeCodeCamp and Microsoft Learn. You’ll access the learning modules via FreeCodeCamp links, which will track your progress and give you the opportunity to sit for a Microsoft Certification exam upon completion.

[CSharp certification - 6 modules](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/foundational-c-sharp-with-microsoft/)

The next course is not part of the certification, but it is a great short example of minimal API.

[Create web apps and services with ASP.NET Core, minimal API, and .NET - 1hr 35min](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/aspnet-core-minimal-api/)

### Route 02. Blended C# and Infrastructure Approach

In this route, you'll combine learning C# with workshops focused on infrastructure essentials. This approach balances language fundamentals with practical infrastructure skills to give you a well-rounded foundation.

You can complete the first three C# lessons independently or through FreeCodeCamp. If you choose the FreeCodeCamp route, you’ll have the option to continue with the remaining lessons later and eventually take the Microsoft Certification exam.
