### Week of November 4th

### Route 01. Csharp Certification

This option focuses entirely on mastering C# before diving into broader .NET concepts. The goal is for you to gain a strong command of the language and become comfortable with its infrastructure. By Week 10, you'll be able to apply what you’ve learned to a hands-on project.

To start, please register on both FreeCodeCamp and Microsoft Learn. You’ll access the learning modules via FreeCodeCamp links, which will track your progress and give you the opportunity to sit for a Microsoft Certification exam upon completion.

### Route 02. Blended C# and Infrastructure Approach

In this route, you'll combine learning C# with workshops focused on infrastructure essentials. This approach balances language fundamentals with practical infrastructure skills to give you a well-rounded foundation.

You can complete the first three C# lessons independently or through FreeCodeCamp. If you choose the FreeCodeCamp route, you’ll have the option to continue with the remaining lessons later and eventually take the Microsoft Certification exam.
