# UI for Quizzer App

Your project this week is to build the front end to consume the RESTful API you designed and built last week.
You should think and plan what features and look you want to your quiz app to have. You might considered making some wire frames or a prototype using a tool like [Figma](https://www.figma.com).

### User Stories

As a **quizzer**, I want to:

- Begin a quiz session with randomly generated questions.
- Filter quiz questions by subject and difficulty.
- Select a chosen number of questions.
- See a summary of my results after completing a quiz.
- Add, edit, and delete quiz questions and answers.

### Stretch user stories

- Like particular questions and filter by this category.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Provide an engaging, intuitive user interface.
- [ ] Allow users to take quizzes based on category, difficulty and count.
- [ ] Allow users to add and delete questions from the 'database'.
- [ ] Follow React principles and best practices.
- [ ] Follow good accessibility practices.
- [ ] Hidden environment variables (i.e. not on GitHub).

### Stretch criteria

- [ ] User local storage to allow for records to persist after browser refresh.
- [ ] Make custom hooks to encapsulate repetitive logic i.e. fetch data or adding to local storage.
